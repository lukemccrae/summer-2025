Homeostasis drives physiology

Anatomy
study of body structures
1600BC

Physiology
Study of function
Individual and cooperative
CELL - Processes within and between cells
ORGAN - functions of specific organs
SYSTEMIC - functions of organ system
PATHOLOGICAL - effects of diseases

Microscopic anatomy
Cytology - study of cells
Histology - study of tissue

Levels of organization
chemical 
Atoms, molecules are collections
Cellular
Groups of atoms, molecules, organelles working together
Tissue
Group of similar cells working together
Organ
Group of different tissues working together

Atom -> chemical -> protein -> tissue -> organ -> organ system -> organism

Organ systems
Integumentary
Skin, hair, sweat glands
Protects against environment
Regulate temp
Provide sensory info

Skeletal
Bones, cartilage, ligaments, bone marrow
Support, calcium store, forms blood cells


Muscular
Skeletal muscles and tendons
Movement
Protection for tissue
Generate heat

Nervous system
Brain, spine, peripheral nerves, sense organs
pass response stimuli
Interpret sense info

Endocrine system
Pituitary, pancreas, gonadsm thyroid, adrenal, endocrine tissue
Direct long term change 
Adjust metabolic activity
Control structural and functional changes during development

Cardiovascular system
Heart, Blood, Blood vessels
Distribute blood cells, water, materials and nutrients, waste product, oxygen, distribute heat

Lymphatic system
Spleen, thymus, lym[h vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils
Defend against infection, return tissue fluid to blood stream

Respiratory system
Nasal cavities, larynx, trachea,bronchi, lungs, alveoli (lung sacks)
Deliver air to lungs, remove carbon dioxide, produce sound

Digestive system
Mouth, teeth, esophogas, intestines,m liver, gallbladder, pancreas
Digest food, process water, produce waste

Urinary
Kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra
Excrete waste, control water balance, stores urine, regulate blood ion concntrations and ph

Reproductive
Male - testes, epididymides, ductus deferentia, smenical vesicles, prostate gland, penis, scrotum
Female - ovaries, uterine tube, uterus, vagina, labia, clitoris, mammary gland
Produce femalxe sex cells, support developing embryo, provide milk

CH 2
Cellular respiration - 3 steps
Glycolysis
Citric acid cycle
Electron transport chain

Glycolosys
Glyco - break, ysis - sugar

Hydrogen key part of process

Each carbon of the glucose has 2 hydrogens
6 oxygons



Oxygen is greedy, hogs electrons

Goal:  get hydrogen to the citric acid cycle (and finally the electron transport chain)

The point is to get the hydrogens off of the oxygons

Enzyme splits the carbons in half

Pyruvate is the resulting 3 carbon chain

What comes out of glycolysis
Pyruvic acid
2 ATP
NADH which carries the hydrogens (otherwise they would bond to something)

Citric Acid Cycle - inputs 
Acetyl-coenzyme A (2 pyruvate)
NADH w/ APT
Oxygon

This is where carbon and oxygen comes off glucose

What comes out
FAFH2
2 ATP

Got lots of carriers with hydrogen! 

All this is happening on membrane of mitochondria
Electron transport chain - INPUTS
NADH
FADH2

On membrane is protein called ATP Synthase 
“ASE” means ENZYME

Hydrogen carrier NADH “goes over” these, making it lose the hydrogen

This process caused hydrogen to lose electron, causing hydrogen to be positively charged

NADH goes back

Now we are at a CONCENTRATION GRADIENT
All hydrogens on one side, and now the hydrogens “want” to bond with whats on the other side of the gradient
The ETC harnesses this

Often the body creates a dam, pumps water, and harnesses the dam for energy

Two aspects of this energy
Hydrogen wants to bond because its hydrogen
Positively charged because no electrons

ATP synthase “turns the wheel” with the positive hydrogen, and this turns ADP into ATP
28-32 ATP generated here

Hydrogen bonds to oxygen
